	<h1>Hey All-- We Got This!!!!!</h1>

    <p>Hello all! I am a fellow learner who has been down the rabbit hole of self-doubt, taken a year away from learning web development, and then come back stronger than ever after really thinking about my motivations for learning and the boundaries I set on myself. Here is something I hope inspires or helps others to not feel alone in the journey. Best of luck on your learning! </p>
    
    <p>Learning to code might not be for everyone, but please never discount yourself by saying things like "I'm too old to start now" or "I'll never learn this". These types of negative messages only hold you back from becoming the best version of yourself.</p>

    <p>Once you realize this like I finally have, instead of seeing yourself in competition with all the others out there, you can see that you are really only in competition with yourself and what you tell yourself you can or cannot do.</p>
    <p> To put it into perhaps better wording, it is better to be kind to yourself, give yourself permission to enjoy the learning for its own sake, and to realize that you will be "x" age a year from now whether you learn new skills or not.</p>
    <p> Would you rather be a more skilled, more focused, and more career-ready version of yourself a year from now or would you rather give up now because others are out there doing it too?</p>

    <p> I could put it into mantra form like this:<br><br><mark><em> "I am only myself. I can become the best version of myself that I can be and I deserve the chance to try"</mark></em>,<br><br> and then get the heck out of my own way and let myself soar!</p>
    
    <p>I am so excited to see where this journey leads me and I wake up every morning feeling powered up and ready to learn more. (Ok, well after I have my coffee anyways.)</p>
